# MGE4SL
In this project, we developed a Multi-Graph Ensemble (MGE) framework combining graph neural network and existing knowledge about genes to predict synthetic lethal (SL) gene pairs.
The work was presented at the 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC), Oct 31 - Nov 4, 2021.
